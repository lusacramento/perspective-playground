# CSS Perspective Playgroud
This aplication is based on *"Complete Vue Developer Bootcamp (Pinia, Vitest)"* course (section 3 - Project 1: Perspective Playground)

The main difference between original source and this implamantation are:
* I utilized **Components** directory instead of the single file;
* I replaced the sliders coded in line to **V-For directives**;
* Also, I used data **composables** to store the global variables;
* I removed CSS-Doodle dependency because conflict between Nuxt and it.
